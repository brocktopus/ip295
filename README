This project is a collection of Arduino and Processing sketches, along with related texts, for the Fall 2011 semester IP 295 "Introduction to Humanities Physical Computing" course at North Carolina State University.

To make full use of the sketches, you'll need to download the IDEs for Processing (http://www.processing.org) and Arduino (http://www.arduino.cc), as well as picking up an Arduino microcontroller.

To view the schematics provided for most of the sketches, download Fritzing (http://www.fritzing.org).
